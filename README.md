# Work summary
This work has been done during my second semester of a master's degree in Sorbonne University, under the supervision of $\textbf{Claire Boyer}$, and has been part of an UE called $\textbf{Research and Study Work}$.

Related to the field of Machine Learning, this work leads to a simple general undestanding of $\textbf{Conformal Prediction}$, a modern issue which becomes very important for high risk settings in many domains, such as medicine diagnostics, wheather reports or either environment, where a wrong predictions could aim to consequential model failures.

# Conformal Prediction summary services 

As I explained above, Conformal Prediction is very useful when your prediction has to be perfect. This field of machine learning is very useful in both $\textbf{Regression}$ and $\textbf{Classification}$.

The main goal is to construct prediction sets/intervals to be able to quantify our prediction error, whatever the model used; Theoritically, the sets are construct in a free distribution sence. You can use Conformal Prediction for pre-trained models like Hugging Face models, but also for your model trained from scratch.
