# Work summary
This work has been done during my second semester of a master's degree in Sorbonne University, under the supervision of $\textbf{Claire Boyer}$, and has been part of an UE called $\textbf{Research \,\, and \,\, Study \,\, Work}$.
\newline
Related to the field of Machine Learning, this work leads to a simple general undestanding of $\textbf{Conformal Prediction}$, a modern issue which becomes very important for critical predictions in many fields, such as medicine, wheather reports or environment.   

# Conformal Prediction summary services 

As I explained above, Conformal Prediction is very useful when your prediction has to be perfect. This field of machine learning is very useful in both $\textbf{Regression}$ and $\textbf{Classification}$.
\newline
The main goal is to construct prediction sets/intervals to be able to quantify our prediction error.
