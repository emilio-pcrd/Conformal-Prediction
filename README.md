# Work summary
This work has been done during my second semester of a master's degree in Sorbonne University, under the supervision of $\textbf{Claire Boyer}$, and has been part of a course called $\textbf{Research and Study Work}$.

Related to the field of Machine Learning, this work leads to a simple general understanding of $\textbf{Conformal Prediction}$, a modern issue which becomes very important for high risk settings in many domains, such as medicine diagnostics, wheather reports or either environment, where a wrong prediction could lead to consequential model failures.

# Conformal Prediction summary services

As I explained above, Conformal Prediction is very useful when your prediction needs to be very accurate. This field of machine learning gathers both $\textbf{Regression}$ and $\textbf{Classification}$.

The main goal is to build prediction sets/intervals to be able to quantify the prediction error, whatever which model is used; Theorically, the prediction sets are built in a free distribution sence.

## Used Python Libraries
